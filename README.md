This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  The issue arises from directly parsing the user ID as an integer without validation, potentially causing the application to crash or return unexpected results if the ID is not a number. The solution incorporates input validation and comprehensive error handling to prevent these issues.  This is a crucial aspect of building secure and reliable Express.js applications.
